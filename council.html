		<h1>Council</h1>
		<h2>Financial Council</h2>
		<p>Since 1983, the Code of Canon Law (c. 537) requires that "each parish is to have a
        finance council which is regulated by universal law as well as by norms issued by the diocesan bishop; in this council,
        the Christian faithful, selected according to the same norms, aid the pastor in the administration of parish goods."
        This canon makes it clear, however, that the finance council does not substitute for the pastor as the chief administrator
        and legal representative of the parish's goods and refers to canon 532 which charges the pastor to care for the parish's
        goods and to represent the parish in all juridic affairs.<br>
        <h3>What is the Finance Council?</h3>
		<p>The Finance Council is
        a consultative body composed of parishioners to advise the Pastor in matters pertaining to the
        financial affairs of the parish. The Finance Council meets four-six times per year to review the financial statements
        and to establish the budget for the upcoming year. Members are appointed by the Pastor and serve a two-year term and can
        be renewed for a second term. The Finance Council is directed by the values of the Gospel in fulfilling its responsibilities,
        as well as by good business practices. Efficient and effective use and management of parish resources must be measured as
        much by their contribution to parish mission and ministry as by commonly accepted business standards.</p>

		<h2>Pastoral Council</h2>
		<p>The pastoral council collaborates with the pastor to develop priorities and directions
        for the parish. The Council is to become the means of achieving full participation by the whole parish community in its
        mission by giving all a voice in discerning the direction of our parish life, in accordance with our identity and mission.</p>
