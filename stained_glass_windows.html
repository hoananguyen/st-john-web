		<h1>The Meaning Behind Our Stained Glass Windows</h1>
		<h2>MAIN ENTRY</h2>
		<h3>The Holy Family</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_holy_family.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>As members of our parish family, their extended families,
        and visitors come to St. John's to celebrate Mass or to receive a sacrament, they find the <b>Holy Family</b> above
        the doors of the main entry. Jesus, with open arms, beckons all who are weary and burdened to come to Him. Mary,
        our Holy Mother, clasps her hands in prayer while Joseph, the Holy Spouse, and protector of the young family, stands
        strong and stalwart. In Jesus, Mary and Joseph, we find a perfect example of love and devotion to each other and to
        God. They invite all to worship here because indeed all are welcome.</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h2>NAVE</h2>
		<p>After passing through the vestibule, four doors open to our nave
        (the main body of the church) and direct our attention to the sanctuary, with the altar and the Eucharist,
        the presence of God in our midst.<br><br>Here, in our stained glass windows, God reveals the path to salvation
        through His Son, Jesus, the Lamb of God.</p>
		<h3>The Nativity</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_nativity.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>In the stable Mary and Joseph look adoringly at the
        Christ Child. Animals surround the Holy Family in this depiction of the birth of Jesus, but in the distance,
        a faint cross is seen, a foreshadowing of His sacrifice for our salvation. At the top of the window are found
        the symbols Alpha and Omega, signifying that God is the whole of everything, the beginning and the end. "Yes,
        God so loved the world that he gave his only son." (<i>John 3:16</i>)</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>The Baptism of Jesus</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_baptism_of_jesus.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>The Holy Spirit descends like a dove at Christ's baptism
        and the voice of the Father is heard as John the Baptist stands as witness and joyful observer. The three persons of the
        Holy Trinity are presented, as Jesus begins His ministry on earth. The lifeless tree recalls that death was the consequence
        of sin; the flourishing tree symbolizes the new life in Christ that comes to us through Baptism. "This is my beloved son.
        My favor rests on him." (<i>Matthew 3:17</i>)</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>The Good Shepherd</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_good_shepherd.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>Christ is the Good Shepherd who gives His life for His sheep. Jesus
        is shown holding the once-lost sheep that is now rejoining the flock. Christ is our Good Shepherd. He searches for us,
        rejoices when we are found, and brings us back into communion with Him. A Celtic cross near the top is a tribute to
        Father Michael O'Flaherty, St. John's pastor at the time the church was built. "I am the Good Shepherd. I know my
        sheep and my sheep know me." (<i>John 10:14</i>)</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>The Transfiguration</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_transfiguration.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>The power and divinity of Christ shines through at the
        miracle of the Transfiguration, when Moses and Elijah join a glorified Christ on the high mountain in full sight of
        disciples Peter, James and John, who were at the same time amazed, astonished and afraid. A cross with shining rays
        is shown at the top of the window, recalling the radian light of the Transfiguration. "This is my Son, my beloved.
        Listen to him." (<i>Mark 9:7</i>)</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>The Raising of Lazarus</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_raising_of_lazarus.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>When Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, He called
        His friend directly out of the tomb. Lazarus is seen still wearing his burial clothes. His sisters, Mary and Martha,
        along with the crowd of mourners, are overcome with joy as they see their brother and friend alive again.<br><br>The
        Chi-Rho (x laying over a P) at the top of the window is the oldest known monogram for Christ. "Whoever believes
        in me, though he should die, will come to life." (<i>John 11:26</i>)</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>The Last Supper</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_last_supper.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>Jesus is seen blessing the bread and wine, as He shares a
        Passover meal with His disciples. He knows what is to come and He wants to spend time with His friends before His
        Passion. He commends them to a life of service, represented by the silver basin; with another purpose in mind, Judas
        is seen preparing to leave to betray Jesus.<br><br>Shown at the top of this window are the Chalice and the Host. "Do
        this in memory of me." (<i>Luke 22:19</i>)</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>The Crucifixion</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_crucifixion.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>Jesus is on the cross. His mother, Mary, and the
        beloved disciple, John, are there with Him. The sky is dark, even though it is still early in the day. Jesus
        is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world with His sacrifice. He fulfilled His mission for the
        salvation of the world.<br><br>At the top of the window we see the Crowd of Thorns. "Father, into your hands I
        commend my spirit." (<i>Luke 23:46</i>)</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>The Resurrection</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_resurrection.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>Jesus has been crucified. The disciples are both scared
        and grief-stricken, hiding in an upper room. Suddenly, the Risen Christ appears in their midst. They are overcome
        with fear, amazement, relief and unimaginable joy. His is alive! He speaks words of comfort and peace, and
        commissions them to share the Good News of salvation to the world.<br><br>The Ichthys (fish) is shown at the top, the
        word an acronym for Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior. "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send
        you." (<i>John 20:21</i>)</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>Easter Morning</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_altar_1.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>Behind the altar and in the windows above the <b>Sanctuary</b>
        we revefe God - Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Our Lord's Passion and Death are remembered in the solitary image of
        Christ on the cross that hangs solemnly above the tabernacle.</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>He is Risen</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_altar_2.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>High above the crucifix, the miracle of His resurrection
        shines forth from the two windows that depict the glory and the symbolism of <b>Easter Morning.</b></p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h2>QUIET ROOM</h2>
		<p>In our <b>Quiet Room,</b> child-centered themes reach out to young families.</p>
		<h3>Presentation of Jesus</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_presentation_of_jesus.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>Mary and Joseph bring the baby Jesus to the
        Temple for consecration and encounter the prophets Simeon and Anna, who see in Jesus the salvation of Israel.</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>Teaching in the Temple</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_teaching_in_the_temple.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>At the age of twelve, Jesus is found in the
        Temple in the company of the elders, astounding them with His knowledge and understanding.</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>Jesus Feeds the Multitudes</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_jesus_feeds_the_multitudes.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>In a foreshadowing of the gift of the
        Eucharist, Jesus multiplies the loaves and fish offered by a young boy, to feed a crowd of over five thousand.</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>Let the Children Come to Me</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_let_the_children_come_to_me.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>Jesus invites children to come close
        to Him. Children of different race and gender are depicted to signify the truth that we are all God's children.</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h2>CHAPEL</h2>
		<p>The Old Testament story of God's promise and the New Testament fulfillment
        of that promise are recalled in the <b>Chapel</b> windows. The two windows to the left when facing the altar feature
        Old Testament themes, while the two windows to the right recall New Testament themes. The altar is the physical bridge
        between the two. The central element in the Old Testament windows is the Torah, while the central element in the New
        Testament windows is the Bible.</p>
		<h3>The Old Testament<br><br>"In the beginning…" (<i>Genesis 1:1</i>)</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_old_testament.webp" />
			</div>
			<p><b>Adam and Eve</b>
        fell from grace, and "The Lord God banished them" (<i>Genesis 3:23</i>), their sin having
        brought death and separation from God. Yet, our loving Father did not wish for us to be separated and thus began
        His plan for our redemption. The Tree of Knowledge is depicted, a symbol of our fall from grace.<br><br>Though childless,
        <b>Abraham and Sarah</b> trusted in God's unfathomable promise when He said, "I will multiply you exceedingly"
        (<i>Genesid 17:2</i>). With this covenant, the plan begins. The Altar of Sacrifice is depicted, recalling
        Abraham's trust in God.<br><br>Through <b>Moses,</b> God made known that we should "love the Lord, your God, with all
        your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength" (<i>Deuteronomy 6:5</i>). The Ark of the Covenant
        is depicted, created at God's direction, to hold the symbol of the covenant God made with His people.<br><br><b>David</b>
        placed his trust in God declaring, "The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom should I fear?" (<i>Psalms 27:1</i>).
        From this branch of Jesse's tree, God brought forth His royal dynasty. The Lyre depicts the instrument used by David
        in his songs of praise to God.</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>The Prophets<br><br>"The Word of God comes truly from your mouth" (<i>1 Kings 17:24</i>)</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_prophets.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>For ages, God relied on many prophets to speak of His people in
        order to bring about His plan of redemption. These four reveal key points in the story of salvation.<br><br><b>Isaiah</b>
        lived in Jerusalem in the 8th century B.C. and while there were other prophets before him historically, there is none greater.
        Debate about authorship has existed for centuries and still continues. Isaiah, shown with the Star of Bethlehem, foretold the
        birth of the Messiah (<i>Isaiah 9:6</i>).<br><br><b>Jeremiah</b> revealed that God's covenant was to be written on our hearts, that
        He would be our God and we would be His people (<i>Jeremiah 31:33</i>). He is shown with the Torah.<br><br><b>Ezekiel</b> made known
        that God was to be a shepherd for His people, finding the lost and bringing back those who stray (<i>Ezekiel 34:15-16</i>). He is
        shown with a lamb.<br><br><b>Zachariah,</b> like Ezekiel, was a visionary. His book contains detailed references to the Messiah which
        are clearly fulfilled in the life of Christ. Shown with the dove, he proclaimed that God's peace will be for all nations
        (<i>Zachariah 9:10</i>).</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>The New Testament<br><br>"Make disciples of all nations" (<i>Matthew 28:19</i>)</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_new_testament.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>God's promise of redemption for His people is fulfilled through
        men and women who trusted in God's will.<br><br><b>St. Peter,</b> a simple fisherman, became a "fisher of men"
        (<i>Mark 1:17</i>).<br>He is depicted along with the Keys to the Kingdom, a symbol of the responsibility Peter and his successors
        bear for the people of God, until the return of Jesus.<br><br><b>Mary, Mother of God,</b> with her act of faith, was proclaimed,
        "Blessed among women" by the Angel Gabriel, as the Annunciation is depicted (<i>Luke 1:28</i>). Through her the Son of God
        became flesh, to dwell among His people and to break the bonds of death and sin. Her symbol is the rosary, shared with us to
        draw us into meditation upon the Life, Death and Resurrection of Jesus. "Holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now and
        at the hour of our death. Amen"<br><br><b>St. Paul</b> became a missionary, traveling much of the Roman Empire to proclaim the Good
        News. At the end, even though he was imprisoned and on the verge of execution, he remained confident in God's promise of eternal
        life, having "fought the good fight", "finished the race" and "kept the faith" (<i>2 Timothy 4:7</i>). A map depicts the
        territory he traveled.<br><br><b>Mary Magdalene</b> is named in all four gospels as a witness to Christ's crucifixion, burial
        and resurrection. She came from Magdala, a town located on the sea of Galilee, just north of Tiberius. She is shown with
        an Easter Lily, as she announces to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord." (<i>John 20:18</i>).</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h3>The Evangelists<br><br>"And the Word became flesh" (<i>John 1:14</i>)</h3>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_evangelists.webp" />
			</div>
			<p><b>St. Matthew</b> is shown with his icon, a winged man, because his
        Gospel emphasizes the human nature of Jesus and the Kingdom of Heaven. He recalls for us the promise of Jesus: "Know that I am
        with you always, until the end of the world" (<i>Matthew 28:20</i>). Each of the four gospels has its own special emphasis.
        Matthew, writing for his fellow Jews, concentrates on Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah. While the gospel does not actually name
        its author, from early times it has been attributed to Matthew the apostle and one-time tax collector. Much of Matthew's material
        is almost identical with Mark's gospel, whose source of information was Peter. Most scholars believe that Matthew drew on Mark -
        not vice versa.<br><br><b>St. Mark</b> has as his symbol the winged lion, and informs us of the royal dignity of Christ. He shares the
        declaration that the disciples - and we, also His disciples - are to "Go into the whole world and proclaim the good news
        to all creation" (<i>Mark 16:15</i>). Mark's gospel is bursting with life; full of action. Mark often explains Jewish
        customs, so he obviously had non-Jewish readers in mind. Whereas Matthew's gospel is formal and stately, in Mark we see
        Jesus in action. Action, rather than teaching, is emphasized.<br><br><b>St. Luke</b> is shown with his symbol, the winged ox,
        an animal of sacrifice; his Gospel recalls the sacrificial aspects of Christ's life. He recalls the fulfillment in the New
        Testament of the promise in the Old Testament: "Thus it is written that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise
        from the dead" (<i>Luke 24:46</i>). The most complete life-story of Jesus is found in Luke's gospel. He shows Jesus as the
        Savior of all mankind; His coming, a world event. He lets us see Jesus the man. The writer's warm interest in people is
        seen, especially with regard to the sick and helpless, the poor, women, children, and social outcasts. Luke is an artist with
        words and a great storyteller.<br><br><b>St. John, Our Patron,</b> is found with his icon, the eagle, for it is said that his
        gaze pierced far into the mysteries of heaven. John's gospel is strikingly different from the other three. It is the last
        to be written and seems to assume that the readers already know the facts about Jesus' life. John's main goal is to bring
        the reader to faith. There are no parables in John. Most of the events recorded take place in and around Jerusalem at the
        various festivals. The keynote of John's gospel is Jesus as Messiah and Son of God. At the end of the gospel, John finishes
        the story thus: "It is this same disciple who is the witness to those things; it is he who wrote them down and his testimony,
        we know, is true" (<i>John 21:24</i>).</p>
		</div><br><br>
		<h2>BRIDE'S ROOM</h2>
		<p>In our Bride's Room, we commemorate the first miracle of Jesus at the
        <b>Wedding Feast in Cana,</b> where He changes water into wine, the beginning of His transformative work. The Sacrament
        of Marriage models the mystery of the life-giving love between Christ and His Church.</p><br><br>

				<img src="./images/stained_glass_bride_room_1.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>"A man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, and the two of them become on body" (<i>Genesis 2:24</i>).</p><br><br>
		</div><br><br>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_bride_room_2.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>"If we love one another, God remains in us, and His love is brought to perfection in us" (<i>1 John 4:12</i>).</p><br><br>
		</div><br><br>
		<h2>THE ASCENSION</h2>
		<div class="square">
			<div class="wrap-around-img">
				<img src="./images/stained_glass_the_ascension.webp" />
			</div>
			<p>As He was ascending into Heaven, Christ told his apostles "you will
        be my witnesses… in every part of the world" (<i>Acts 1:8</i>). The window just above the exit commemorates <b>Christ's
        Ascension into Heaven</b> and we are reminded of His promise that He will come again in power and in glory.</p><br><br>
